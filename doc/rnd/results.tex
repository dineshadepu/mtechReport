\section{Discrete element method}

As a first benchmark, studying a freely falling solid sphere onto a
floor. Solid sphere has radius $r_p = 10$ cm, density $\rho_p$ = 2.6 *
1e3 $kg/m^3$, falls from a height $h_0 =$ 0.5 m under gravity.


For a freely falling solid, we have an analytical solution. Implementing
it using DEM, and comparing the results could give us an idea of accuracy of
the numerical method. Here we compare analytical solution of  position and velocity
with DEM result.
